## üèúÔ∏è Hosea ‚Äì Nahal Qelt (Wadi Qelt)
*Dry ravines, longing hearts. A love that won't quit.*

**About the River:** Nahal Qelt (Wadi Qelt) is a dramatic desert canyon that cuts through the Judean wilderness between Jerusalem and Jericho. This seasonal stream flows only during winter rains, leaving behind a stark, beautiful gorge most of the year. Ancient monasteries cling to its walls, where hermits sought God in the silence. Like God's love for unfaithful Israel, this wadi represents enduring presence even in the driest seasons.

## üåä Joel ‚Äì Jordan River
*Destruction and renewal in the valley of decision.*

**About the River:** The Jordan River is Israel's most sacred waterway, flowing from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea. Its name means "descender," and it has witnessed pivotal moments‚ÄîJoshua's crossing, Elijah's ascension, and Jesus' baptism. The Jordan represents both endings and beginnings, death and life, judgment and renewal. Joel's locust plague and promised restoration echo the river's own seasonal cycles of flood and recession.

## ‚õ∞Ô∏è Amos ‚Äì Kishon River

Amos's call for justice to "roll down like waters" echoes the Kishon's powerful seasonal floods.

## üèûÔ∏è Obadiah ‚Äì Arnon (Wadi Mujib)
*Borders breached. Pride undone.*

**About the River:** The Arnon River (modern Wadi Mujib) forms a spectacular canyon on the eastern edge of the Dead Sea, historically marking the border between Moab and Ammon. This dramatic gorge, sometimes called the "Grand Canyon of Jordan," represents the boundaries that nations trust in and the pride that comes before a fall. Just as the Arnon carved through solid rock over millennia, God's judgment cuts through human arrogance.

*Justice outside the city walls.*

**About the River:** The Kidron Brook flows along the eastern wall of Jerusalem, separating the holy city from the Mount of Olives.

**About the River:** The Ga'aton Stream flows from the hills of Galilee to the Mediterranean near Nahariya.

## üåà Zechariah ‚Äì Chebar River

Zechariah's visions of restoration echo the promise that God's people will return from distant waters.

**About the River:** Nahal Tavor flows from the slopes of Mount Tabor, the traditional site of Jesus' transfiguration. This stream represents the last prophetic voice before the great silence, the final call to faithfulness before the long wait for Messiah. Like the stream that flows from the mountain of God's glory, Malachi's words carry the weight of ending and the promise of beginning.
